# LinkedList
This is my implementation of linked list. 
This linked list has all four crud operations and provides a fairly convenient api to use it.

you can add, remove, or replace a node either via its index or by pandasing the node's content.

It also has convenient methods, such as the following:
add a list of items by passing a list to the ```addAll()``` method
remove all elements from the list using the ```removeAll()``` method
replace the header using the ```replaceHead()``` method

All the methods in this list are tested to verify that it works correctly.

There are still some security improvements that could be added, replacing the base interface with an abstract class. But this will be added in the future, since I have developed this project to improve my programming logic
